## What is a PDF File?
 
A PDF file is an abbreviation that stands for Portable Document Format[^3^]. It is a versatile file format created by Adobe that gives people an easy, reliable way to present and exchange documents - regardless of the software, hardware, or operating systems being used by anyone who views the document[^3^]. The PDF format is now an open standard, maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)[^3^].
 
A PDF file can contain text, images, graphics, hyperlinks, annotations, forms, digital signatures, and more. It can also preserve the layout, fonts, colors, and quality of the original document. A PDF file can be encrypted, compressed, or password-protected to enhance its security and portability. A PDF file can be viewed on any device that supports the format, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, e-readers, or printers.
