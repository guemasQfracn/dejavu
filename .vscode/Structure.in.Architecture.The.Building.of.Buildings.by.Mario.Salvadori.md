In this book, you will learn about the fundamental concepts of structural behavior, such as forces, stresses, strains, stability, equilibrium, and deformation. You will also explore the different structural forms, such as beams, trusses, arches, cables, shells, frames, and domes. You will discover how these forms are used to create various types of buildings, such as bridges, skyscrapers, stadiums, cathedrals, and monuments. You will also find topics beyond the basics, such as structural optimization, earthquake-resistant design, wind loads, fire resistance, and sustainability.
 
The book is written by Mario Salvadori, a renowned engineer and educator who taught at Columbia University for over 40 years. He was also a coauthor of several other books on structures and materials. He was joined by Robert A. Heller, a professor of engineering science and mechanics at Virginia Tech who collaborated with Salvadori on the previous editions of this book and a video series on mechanics of structures and materials. The fourth edition of the book was updated by Deborah J. Oakley, an associate professor at the School of Architecture at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas who has been teaching structures to architecture students for nearly 20 years.
 
If you want to download a PDF version of **Structure in Architecture: The Building of Buildings** by Mario Salvadori, you can find it online from various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

**Structure in Architecture: The Building of Buildings** by Mario Salvadori is not only a book for students of architecture and engineering, but also for anyone who is interested in the art and science of building. The book is written in a clear and engaging style that makes complex concepts easy to understand and appreciate. The book also features many examples and case studies of famous and iconic buildings from different historical periods and cultural contexts. You will learn how these buildings were designed and constructed, and how they reflect the structural challenges and solutions of their times.
 
The book also encourages you to think critically and creatively about the role of structure in architecture. You will learn how to analyze the structural behavior of different building elements and forms, and how to apply this knowledge to your own design projects. You will also learn how to balance the functional, aesthetic, and environmental aspects of building design, and how to optimize the structural performance and efficiency of your buildings. You will also learn how to address the social and ethical implications of building design, such as safety, accessibility, durability, and resilience.
 
In summary, **Structure in Architecture: The Building of Buildings** by Mario Salvadori is a comprehensive and inspiring guide to the fundamentals and applications of structural mechanics in architecture. It is a book that will enrich your understanding and appreciation of the built environment, and help you develop your own skills and vision as a designer. Whether you are a student, a professional, or a curious reader, you will find this book to be a valuable and enjoyable resource.
